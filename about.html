  <small>To those who do not know mathematics it is difficult to get across a real feeling as to the beauty, the deepest beauty,
    of nature. â€¦ If you want to learn about nature, to appreciate nature, it is necessary to understand the language that
    she speaks in.

<br> I graduated from the University of Connecticut in 2016 with a degree in pure mathematics. That May, I moved to Boston and
stayed for two years at the Institute for Technology Assessment, Massachusetts General Hospital / Harvard Medical School.
I was a computer scientist and mathematician, working on a wide variety of research projects including topics such as stroke,
neonatal resuscitation, esophageal adenocarcinoma, and thyroid cancer. I'm currently at student at Tulane University School
of Medicine working towards an MD. Publications can be found at my
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=S-iDFMsAAAAJ&hl=en">google scholar page</a>. My future interests include, broadly, improving pediatric emergency / trauma care in low-resource
settings.
