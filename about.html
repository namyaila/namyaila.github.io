    Let me say this very clearly: the humanitarian act is the
    most apolitical of all acts, but if its actions and its morality are taken
    seriously, it has the most profound of political implications. And the fight
    against impunity is one of these implications.</i>

<br>
I graduated from the University of Connecticut in 2016 with a degree in pure mathematics. That May, I moved to Boston
and
stayed for two years at the Institute for Technology Assessment, Massachusetts General Hospital / Harvard Medical
School.
I was a computer scientist and mathematician, working on a wide variety of research projects including topics such as
stroke,
neonatal resuscitation, esophageal adenocarcinoma, and thyroid cancer. I'm currently at student at Tulane University
School
of Medicine working towards an MD. Publications can be found at my
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=S-iDFMsAAAAJ&hl=en">google scholar page</a>. My future interests
include, broadly, improving pediatric emergency / trauma care in low-resource
settings.

I spend a lot of time training Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (submission grappling) with whatever striking is available. Also, I
like to be
outside and run along bodies of water.
