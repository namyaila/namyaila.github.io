You'll probably recognize some of these from index cards I've taped to my laptop since I was a freshman in college. They're organized by author and I try to keep it updated as I read. Each author has been a huge influence on me in their own way.

### James Orbinski

“Let me say this very clearly: the humanitarian act is the most apolitical of all acts, but if its actions and its morality are taken seriously, it has the most profound of political implications. And the fight against impunity is one of these implications.” - Nobel Prize Speech

### Albert Einstein

“Although I am a typical loner in my daily life, my awareness of belonging to the invisible community of those who strive for truth, beauty, and justice has prevented me from feelings of isolation.”

### Bertrand Russell

"Love and knowledge, so far as they were possible, led upward toward the heavens. But always pity brought me back to earth. Echoes of cries of pain reverberate in my heart. Children in famine, victims tortured by oppressors, helpless old people a hated burden to their sons, and the whole world of loneliness, poverty, and pain make a mockery of what human life should be. I long to alleviate the evil, but I cannot, and I too suffer. This has been my life. I have found it worth living, and would gladly live it again if the chance were offered me." - Autobiography, Prologue

"As a lover of truth, the national propaganda of all the belligerent nations sickened me. As a lover of civilization, the return to barbarism appalled me." - Autobiography, chapter 8, p. 241

"'When you were in the water, did you not think of mysticism and logic?' 'No', I said. 'What did you think of?' the voice persisted. 'I thought the water was cold'" - Autobiography, chapter 14, p. 512

### Richard Feynman

"To those who do not know mathematics it is difficult to get across a real feeling as to the beauty, the deepest beauty, of nature. … If you want to learn about nature, to appreciate nature, it is necessary to understand the language that she speaks in." - chapter 2, The Relation of Mathematics to Physics, p. 58

### Muhammad Ali

"The fight is won or lost far away from witnesses - behind the lines, in the gym, and out there on the road, long before I dance under those lights."

### Rumi

"\
Knock, and He'll open the door.\
Vanish, and He'll make you shine like the sun.\
Fall, and He'll raise you to the heavens\
Become nothing, and He'll turn you into everything.\
"

### Albert Camus

“I used to advertise my loyalty and I don't believe there is a single person I loved that I didn't eventually betray." - The Fall
