    If I hear another paraphrased version of "...you're the first thing I think of in the morning and the last before I sleep..." in music or literature I'm not sure how I'll hold it together. The reality is that the first and last thoughts on most people's minds are where their cell phones are and if they'll be missed on social media during the hours they sleep. This post is not going to bash on those connections or judge for having them (in today's world, they're more crucial than not) - rather, my purpose is to stress the importance of solitary reflection.

    Just having time alone is not sufficient, lately people forget to have time with themselves. The distinction that I'm making is not between watching Netflix versus walking outside - it's more subtle than that. It's the difference between going to the gym with your phone in your hand (side note, if you’re texting for 5 minutes between sets in the squat rack I probably hate you) and going with only a music player or nothing at all.

    For those that know me, I went through a massive (positive) change in mentality during the summer of 2014 that has been reflected in every aspect of my life. Although causality is always near impossible to pinpoint, what I personally attribute the change to is the two hours I spent every day completely disconnected from the cyber world. If you’re getting a sweaty feeling in the tip of your fingers thinking about it, don’t worry, that’s a completely normal physiological response to anxiety. Anyway, during those daily two hours I forced myself to just think and to be immersed in my own mind (no, I did not die of boredom). It’s a bit extreme to say that I had a revelation, rather, during the course of the summer I slowly drilled though the cloak that all humans naturally maintain in front of others. In the social sciences, this idea is called the theory of dramaturgy – that we all have a different “persona” depending on the “stage” that we are on.  I believe that because of our constant connection to others many people never have a chance to disappear behind the curtains, which brings me to the conclusion of this post.

    Although we are naturally social creatures and thrive off interaction, we all require a dedicated amount of time to ourselves. I promise you, take thirty minutes a day to disconnect and you will find peace in your own mind. I’m not advising you to salute the sun (sorry yoga enthusiasts) or to throw rocks around like a caveman (hey, that’s me). Just breathe, breathe when nobody is watching. Who knows, you may find somebody that you never knew existed.
