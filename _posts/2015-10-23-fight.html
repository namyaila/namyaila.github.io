    The instinct of self-preservation is the most powerful drive for any species, although with humans it is complicated by,
    on occasion, our ability to empathize. Those that have ever been in a situation where the drive has been invoked can
    maybe understand when I say that there’s something about the instinct that’s addicting, something that’s found in the
    intersection of the pain, fear, rage, and adrenaline. In some ways during a fight time moves slower – you can feel the
    skin behind every knuckle, every heartbeat push against your chest, the cold steel of a blade or jagged edge of a bottle
    as it slices through your tissue. In those moments every emotion is converted to a form of strength, rage becomes a motivator
    and fear a shield. And after your first fight whether you are standing or, more often for me to be honest, on the ground
    broken and bloody, you realize that for the first time you were alive. For the first time you felt every string in your
    body vibrate in unison. For the first time you saw purity in the world.

    However, self-preservation is too often thought of as only inspired by boundaries so far that only a fraction of us ever
    will find ourselves on edge. This interpretation is, I believe, a fundamental error and shortcoming. Fights are not just
    physical, nor do they necessarily involve others. In my experience the most important and difficult fight is with yourself,
    a statement that is constantly thrown around. But just because we’re aware of something doesn’t mean that we know what
    to do. Even though most people acknowledge that ‘the fight within is the only true fight’ – whether from reading the
    diary of a 13 year old that just got grounded or the primary account of depression victim – few are ready to take up
    arms. Instead, when the fight or flight response kicks in, most of us choose the latter option.

    Running is weakness. Maybe not to our primitive instincts, but those apply for the most part to external battles, such as
    when you’re about to be mauled by a tiger or your supervisor. If you run from an internal struggle you’re running from
    yourself. You’re running from something that you can’t escape, putting off the inevitable. If you’ve ever woken up, like
    me, feeling as though you could have done more, then do it. Do more, because there’s a good chance that you haven’t done
    enough. I’m aware that this sounds insensitive, maybe in some ways cruel, and I acknowledge that there are times when
    it doesn’t apply. But in the majority of cases when we convince ourselves that we’ve done everything in our power we’re
    lying. And that’s what I’m addressing.

    This is where self-preservation comes in. The only way to be alive is to give every aspiration the urgency and priority of
    life and death. The idea is to mean it, to truly believe that you’ll be mentally shattered if you fail. It takes practice
    to summon that mentality, to hold it close and live by it, but it’s worth it. And by fail I don’t mean fail to succeed,
    I mean fail to do everything in your power to succeed. The difference is not a small one, and just like a physical fight
    you will lose as much as you win. In some ways people look at such a strong motivation as unhealthy, as setting the bar
    too high, but it’s a lie. At some point in our lives we become responsible for our own actions, for some that moment
    comes earlier than others. But once that time comes we need to be careful that we never stop pushing ourselves, never
    stop utilizing the practically infinite strength we’re all given. The most dangerous feeling is contentment. The most
    destructive thought is satisfaction (with respect to yourself, don’t use this logic to end a relationship please).

    I only speak from my experiences, and one example that I have comes from when I was overweight. I was over 225 pounds (6
    feet tall and 240 at the peak) and hated myself for it. But self-hate is equivalent to flight, even if at first it doesn’t
    seem so. The anger that I so stupidly directed at myself was useless, it was a waste of energy and a means to escape
    the real problem. But later I had a moment, a brief spark, when I decided that instead of hating myself for being overweight
    I’d hate myself for not doing anything about it – and that’s when everything changed. I took that anger and, just like
    I would in a physical fight, used it as strength. I used it to propel myself into the weight room, lift harder and better
    every day. Many months later and now I’m 174 pounds and in the best shape of my life, but I’m not done – it’s not about
    weight anymore but about health. I’m proud of myself for what I’ve accomplished but I’m not satisfied. Goals and aspirations,
    like everything else, must evolve. I’ll be fighting this battle until I die – I refuse to leave my (hopefully one day)
    children early because I didn’t take care of myself. Every part of me knows it’s a life and death situation, and because
    of it I’ve never lost the drive. It might sound crazy but at the gym (and wherever else I’m fighting with this mentality)
    I find purity, I find purpose. I feel alive. I haven’t even began the war, but as of right now, in this battle, I’m the
    victor.
