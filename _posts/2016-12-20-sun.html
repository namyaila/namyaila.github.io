    It’s not even 4:00 but it’s obvious that I won’t find any more sleep. I don’t mind, but I do wish the transition wasn’t always
    so violent. It’s always the same nightmare but I cycle through different chapters. Last night’s torture culminated with
    a long fall through darkness, broken only by reality. Still, relatively calm. Some mornings, I wake so on edge and filled
    with adrenaline that it takes hours to shake the sensation and stabilize.

    On warmer days, every day in the summer, I run to a workout park near Boston University and spend an hour or two on the pullup
    bar to try and silence some of the thoughts that won’t stop crashing around in my head. But it is 12 degrees outside
    today. So instead I spend a long time meditating. Pointless though, I still can’t find a way out. Instead I just become
    more and more familiar with my surroundings. Maybe tomorrow.

    Why is it still dark outside?

    I grab my bag and begin my hour long walk to the gym. I get cold in 70 degrees but still don’t wear many layers today – the
    stings from the cold keep my pace quick and my mind distracted. But as I walk I make the mistake of closing my eyes a
    second too long and getting pulled back into my head. If I’m not focused, it takes only seconds for a fleeting thought
    to knock me to my knees. But before I spiral too far I find a strand of mathematics in the fog. I’ve been working on
    a combinatorics problem for days and this could be what I’m missing. I grab the idea, a pen, a notebook, and let the
    math engulf my mind. As I work I lean over the Longfellow bridge and stare into the Charles River. Eternally alone yet
    surrounded by cities on either side, quiet but forever moving. She’s the only one I understand. I wait for the sunrise
    before finishing my walk.

    The gym is enough to finally restrain the voices for the day. I pour myself into my work and the next time I notice the clock
    it’s because the lock is starting to loosen. It’s only 17:25 but it’s somehow as dark again. I head back to the gym to
    buy myself another eight hours of peace.

    Perhaps tomorrow I’ll catch more sunlight.
