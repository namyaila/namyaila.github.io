### important to me

Disparity in access to fundamental rights (i.e. education, healthcare) frustrates and also motives me; obviously, I believe that education and healthcare are fundamental rights.

### athletics

Currently training jiu-jitsu, mixed martial arts (MMA), and occasionally muay thai.

### academic background

I graduated from the University of Connecticut in 2016 with a Bachelors of Science in Pure Mathematics. Since then, I've been at the Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School doing research at the Insitute for Technology Assessment. The work I do is a blend of mathematics, computer science, and medicine. I'll be attending medical school in the fall (M.D. '22).
